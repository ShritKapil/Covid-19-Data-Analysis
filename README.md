# Covid-19-Data-Analysis
TRANSFORMING DATA

In  this, I worked on the COVID-19 Dataset which is in raw format containing some  unwanted columns which I drop using necessary code. Raw data also contain some  null values which has to  be handle  for proper analysis ,so  i  very well handle them using pandas library.

Raw data also  has some columns which have unwanted data types which are creating issue to  perform  aggregations on the numerical columns  so I changed them accordingly.

I also created some necessary columns out of given columns for the granular analysis  like obtaining month and year out of the date that is  given.

Then I make some visualization through charts and graphs using matplotlib to make my work interactive.
